# LLM calculator
This project has no real world use case and is meant to dip my toes into using LLMs.
It is a LLM calculator that uses Gemini as it's LLM API to calculate an expression. It remembers the last response and performs calculations on it's response.

## How to use it?
Download the zip of this repo or clone it. Add a .env file in the base directory of this repo which contains the Gemini API in the format below 
```GOOGLE_API_KEY=API key```
Now, you're good to go. Run the index.py file using  ```python index.py``` You have your calculator up and running.
